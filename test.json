However, due to the [recent changes](https://hypixel.net/threads/update-to-disallowed-modifications-qol-modifications.4043482/) I am releasing an updated version here. This release should be compliant with the new hypixel rules.\r\n\r\nIf you are updating from 1.7.3, read #neu-prereleases on the discord to learn about all the cool new stuff, there is waaaaaay to much for me to be able to list it all here.\r\n\r\nDownload: https://github.com/Moulberry/NotEnoughUpdates/releases/download/2.0-PRE26/NotEnoughUpdates-2.0-PRE26.jar",
